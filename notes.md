# Golang Tutorial

## Introduction
Go was created by a small team within Google comprising of Robert Griesemar, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.

1. Strong (type of a variable can't be changed) and statically typed (variables need to be defined at compile time)

2. Excellent community

3. Simplicity, Fast compile times, Built-in concurrency, compiles down to standalone binaries and Garbage collection
